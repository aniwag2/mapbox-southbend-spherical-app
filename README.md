# South Bend Visualization In Mapbox
This project is my submission for the Spherical Software Engineering Internship Challenge. The purpose of this project is to display a Mapbox map centered somewhere meaningful to me and allowing the user to place pins with descriptions on the map. I chose South Bend, Indiana.
